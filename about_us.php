Welcome back dearest alumni. Genuinely, one of our greatest assets is our global network of 
alumni. This page is to celebrate your achievements and provides you an access to our alumni 
community.Let's discover how to get involved and connect with the university and its
 supporters. Learn about the events we hold, and our services for UNIMAS alumni.
We’re currently in touch with over all of our alumni from across Sarawak and the world, and
 we’re still looking for those we’ve lost contact with. Do you currently receive 
 mailings from us? Have you recently changed address and need to let us know ? Alumni HubCenter 
 maintains a database of thousands of UNIMAS graduates, but we do not have accurate 
 contact details for everyone. Please help us to keep in touch with you. </p>
